\title{Runs exhaustive search on a single node and saves results in txt file.}
\usage{
node(X, n, id = NULL, nbf = 15, delta = seq(0.5, 1, 0.01), cpp = TRUE,
  m0 = 0, CS0 = 3, n0 = 0.001, d0 = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{array with dimensions timeseries x nodes.}

\item{n}{node number.}

\item{id}{subject ID. If set, results are saved to a txt file.}

\item{nbf}{Log Predictive Likelihood will be calculated from (and including) this time point.}

\item{delta}{a vector of potential values for the discount factor.#'}

\item{cpp}{boolean true (default): fast C++ implementation, false: native R code.}

\item{m0}{the value of the prior mean at time t=0, scalar, and assuming the mean is the same for all nodes. The default is zero. (theta0 | y0, phi) ~ N(m0,C*0 x phi^-1).}

\item{CS0}{controls the scaling of the prior variance matrix C*0 at time t=0. The default is 3, giving a non-informative prior, 3 x (p x p) identity matrix.}

\item{n0}{prior hypermarameter of precision phi ~ G(n0/2; d0/2). The default is a non-informative prior, with a value of 0.001. n0 has to be higher than 0.}

\item{d0}{prior hypermarameter of precision phi ~ G(n0/2; d0/2). The default is a non-informative prior, with a value of 0.001.}
